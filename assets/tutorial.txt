This is Rick!
Rick can jump! [Z]
He can run, too. He's pretty fast! [<>]

Rick builds walls, but the bricks fall by themselves.
It's the easiest job in the world! He just has to watch his head.

Sometimes Rick's friends stop by.
Rick makes more friends the taller his wall gets.

Rick could do this forever!
